/*Problem: Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), 
and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -*/

//totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf

//Where :
//hra   = 20% of basic
//da    = 50% of basic
//allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
//allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
//allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
//pf    = 11% of basic.

//Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
//Note: Try finding out a function on the internet to do so

//Constraints :
//0 <= Basic Salary <= 7,500,000
